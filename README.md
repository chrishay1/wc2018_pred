# Monte carlo simulation of the 2018 FIFA World Cup

This repository contains a number of R scripts used to create a monte carlo simulation of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. A write-up of this work can be found at x.

The specific purpose of each script is listed below.
1)Read data from eloratings.R - This script reads a set of rankings for each team from an external website, and results of games from previous World Cups. 
2)exploratory analysis.R - Some initial workings on the relationships (messy)
3)modelling.R - Attempts at modelling a logistic regression model to the data (messy)
4)monte carlo simulation of the world cup.R - Simulating the outcome of the tournament based on the logistic regression model developed above
5)markdown.rmd - the R markdown documenting the output.
